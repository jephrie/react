# What's this about?
After reading [this article](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/were-react-hooks-a-mistake/) i wanted to dive in to these statements:
- "Put another way: class components have a single instance per mounted component, but function components have multiple “instances” — one per render."
- "In a class component, methods always have access to the most up-to-date state because they have a stable reference to the class instance. But in a function component, every render creates new callbacks that close over its own state. Each time the function is called, it gets its own closure. Future renders can’t change the state of past ones."


Notes:
- there is only a functional example available in the article so i added my own class based version
- i wanted to focus in on the different rendering methods of class vs function in react and cut out the conversation about hooks, useEffect and async expectations

Question: Why does functional version alert 0 vs class version alerts 1?

Learnings are as described in the article:
- functional react component renders seem to have contextual data that is a snapshot of the hook state
- class react components renders seem to have a direct reference to state instead of a snapshot
    - this is visible if you click the button twice quickly before the alert pops up


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
